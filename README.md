# Pong
A muck-around with a Pong style game using the old XNA framework.

# Dependencies

* Visual Studio 2010.
* XNA

## Work-around
After installing VS2010 and the XNA framework, you can copy some files between the VS2010 installation folder and another VS installation.
The latest version I had this running was in VS2013.
