# Pong

A muck-around with a Pong style game using the old XNA framework.

## Dependencies

* Visual Studio 2010.
* XNA

## Work-around

After installing VS2010 and the XNA framework, you can copy some files between the VS2010 installation folder and another VS installation.
The latest version I had this running was in VS2013.

## Introduction

This project was started many years ago.  It has helped me learn about the C# language, events and game development.

### Why Pong

Pong is a classic game where two players attempt to score goals against each other to win the game.  Pong is a game that was created a very long time ago when computer technology was still in its infancy.

### Games

The project has a few different types of games within it.

* Standard - two bats, one for each player.
* Hockey - four bats, two for each player.  The two bats for the player move in opposite directions.
* Multi-ball - lots of balls for a single player.  Very manic!

## Possible Road Map

It would be good to convert this to a Unity game.  But, that would take some time.
